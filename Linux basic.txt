What is Linux:-
----------------------------
Limux is a free and open source
  Unix
  Redhat
  Ubuntu
  Centos
  Fedora
  
What is vagrant:-
------------------------------
->Vagrant is open source tool
->Tool which is created Linux instances on fly
                                 |
								 |Nothing but just run few commands 
	Download VM
	Setting up ip address
	settings up memoreys
	settings up network
	settings up default configuration
	
->Just type commands 
   vagrant init
   vagrant up

->Prerequisities
  1.Virtual Box Download(5.0.10)------>
  2.Vagrant Download  (1.7.4)--------->vagrant -v

Linux server:-
---------------------------------------
IP address:192.168.118.192
user:einfochips
passwd:einfochips
Through putty login

LINUX BASICS COMMANDS:-
-----------------------------------------  
$-->Normal User
#-->Root User(Admin)
/-->Root

Linux Directory Structure:-
-----------------------------------

bin    config  home        lib64       mnt   root  srv  usr
boot   dev     initrd.img  lost+found  opt   run   sys  var
cdrom  etc     lib         media       proc  sbin  tmp  vmlinuz




1. / – Root

    Every single file and directory starts from the root directory.
    Only root user has write privilege under this directory.
    Please note that /root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /.


2. /bin – User Binaries

    Contains binary executables.
    Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
    Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.
    For example: ps, ls, ping, grep, cp.


3. /sbin – System Binaries

    Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
    But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose.
    For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

4. /etc – Configuration Files

    Contains configuration files required by all programs.
    This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
    For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf

5. /dev – Device Files

    Contains device files.
    These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
    For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0


6. /proc – Process Information

    Contains information about system process.
    This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
    This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime


7. /var – Variable Files

    var stands for variable files.
    Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory.
    This includes — system log files (/var/log); packages and database files (/var/lib); emails (/var/mail); print queues (/var/spool); lock files (/var/lock); temp files needed across reboots (/var/tmp);


8. /tmp – Temporary Files

    Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
    Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.


9. /usr – User Programs

    Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
    /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
    /usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
    /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
    /usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2


10. /home – Home Directories

    Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
    For example: /home/john, /home/nikita


11. /boot – Boot Loader Files

    Contains boot loader related files.
    Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
    For example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic


12. /lib – System Libraries

    Contains library files that supports the binaries located under /bin and /sbin
    Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
    For example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7


13. /opt – Optional add-on Applications

    opt stands for optional.
    Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
    add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.


14. /mnt – Mount Directory

    Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.


15. /media – Removable Media Devices

    Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
    For examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer


16. /srv – Service Data

    srv stands for service.
    Contains server specific services related data.
    For example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.

------>find . -name devops.txt


SYSTEM COMMANDS:-
---------------------
->The ps command on linux is one of the most basic commands for viewing the processes running on the system. 
->It provides a snapshot of the current processes along with detailed information like user id, cpu usage, memory usage, command name etc. 

   -->ps -aef



kill->kill the pid
    ->kill pid number

EX:-
   sleep 60 &

   kill pid (sleep 60)
   
   kill -9 pid (forcefully)

df -h->This command can be used show the disk space .
      ->like size,used,avail,use%,mounted on.

du-sh->show the current directory list of the files and directory show the sizes.

top->this is used cpu,memory usage space.

free->show the only memory usage.

free -m->show the exact size in mb

uname -a ->your os show the linux machine 64 or 32 bit


         ->64-->x86-64

         ->i386


NETWORK COMMANDS:-
-----------------------------

ifconfig

netstat--->show the total port and which process running or not

netstat -nl

netstat -nl | grep 8080

netstat -nl | grep 9000

yum

apt-get ---->both command download the packages

telnet-------->command can be used current machine port is running or not

            ------------>telnet 192.168.118.193 80

		---------->telnet 192.168.118.193 8080

scp-->scp command can be used copy the file or dir one machine to another remote machine.


-------------->scp hello.txt einfochips@192.168.10.127:/home/einfochips(file)

           ----------------------->scp -r source einfochips@192.168.10.127:/home/einfochip (dir)
 
ssh->>ssh command can be used logging into a remote machine and perfoming executing commands in remote machine

            ---------------------->ssh einfochips@192.168.10.127 'ls'
       
            ---------------------->ssh einfochips@192.168.10.127 'df -h'
